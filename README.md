# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To provide an analysis of the outcomes (succeddful, failed, canceled) of the Theatre category and Play subcategory kickstarters.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Outcome of kickstarters under the parent category of "Theatre", based on launch month. This line chart shows the total number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each month.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Outcome of kickstarters under the subcategory "Plays" based on Goal ranges. Line chart shown in percentage of outcomes for each kickstarter goal range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The outcomes based on goals calculations were very manual and prone to error. Each cell in the sheet has a uniquely structured function. This creates a high chance of error due to a typo or other human error.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theatre campaign successful launches peak in May. Theatre succesfull campaigns drop to their lowest point in December launches.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The highest failure rate for Plays occurs when the goal is in the 45000 to 49999 range.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Campaign outcomes are binary (success or fail) and do not show the range of success or failure (as a percentage of goal acheived for example)

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could add a column to calculate percentage of goal acheived, and then work with that column to provide a more nuanced analysis of the data above.
